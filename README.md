## About me

I’m a generalist game programmer with over a decade of experience.

I’m a generalist who can pick up (and enjoy!) whatever’s needed, and I’ve shipped and supported games for all major modern platforms. I'm skilled with Unity, Unreal, and in-house engines.

As well as I writing code, I have experience leading teams, speaking at conferences all over the world, and lecturing at degree level.

Outside of work, I make [short games](https://reallyfancy.itch.io/) and [electronic music](https://fakemice.bandcamp.com/releases). I'm involved with the local games community and I regularly volunteer at events.
