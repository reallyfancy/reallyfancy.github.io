## About me

I work for [Unity Technologies](http://unity3d.com/) as a Developer Relations Engineer with a focus on performance optimisation.

Outside of work, I make [short games](https://reallyfancy.itch.io/) and organise [Brighton Indies](https://twitter.com/brightonindies) and [Make Play Code](https://twitter.com/makeplaycode).

When I'm not doing anything to do with games I like making music, cooking and visiting theme parks.
