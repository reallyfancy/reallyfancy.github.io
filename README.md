## About me

I’m a game programmer with over a decade of games industry experience.

I’m a generalist who can pick up (and enjoy!) whatever’s needed. I’m particularly knowledgeable about gameplay programming and performance optimisation, and I also have a solid understanding of engine code and graphics programming. I’ve shipped or supported games for all major platforms.

I know the Unity engine inside out - I worked there for six years, and led their European tier 3 support team. I'm also experiend with Unreal and with in-house engines.

I’ve spoken at conferences all over the world and lectured at degree level.

Outside of work, I make [short games](https://reallyfancy.itch.io/) and [music](https://fakemice.bandcamp.com/releases). I'm involved with the local games community and I regularly volunteer at events.

## Freelance work

I'm available for freelance work. I specialise in consultancy about Unity games, with a focus on performance optimisation, architectural best practices, and porting.

For more information, rates, or availability, please send me an email.
