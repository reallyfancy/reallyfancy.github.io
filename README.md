### About me

I'm a programmer, game maker and writer.

I currently work for [Unity Technologies](http://unity3d.com/). I work on the Unity Editor itself and write articles and tutorials about making games using Unity.

When I'm not doing that, I make [short games](https://reallyfancy.itch.io/) and run [Brighton Indies](https://twitter.com/brightonindies) and [Make Play Code](https://twitter.com/makeplaycode).

When I'm not doing anything to do with games, I like making music, cooking and visiting theme parks.
