## About me

During the day, I work for [Unity Technologies](http://unity3d.com/) as a Developer and Trainer. My role is varied - right now I'm developing a new feature for the Unity Editor, creating demo projects and writing tutorials on performance optimisation.

Outside of work, I make games - you can find them on [itch](https://reallyfancy.itch.io/). I'm very involved in the Brighton games scene, and I founded and co-run [Brighton Indies](https://twitter.com/brightonindies) and [Make Play Code](https://twitter.com/makeplaycode). I also speak at conferences, lecture (at college and degree level) and teach kids to code.

When I'm not doing anything to do with games I like making music, cooking and visiting theme parks.

This is a small selection of projects from the last few years. I've worked on a lot of things! Contact me for more details or see [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerryturner) for my career history.
