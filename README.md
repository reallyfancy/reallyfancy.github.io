### About me

I'm a programmer, game maker and writer.

I work for [Unity Technologies](http://unity3d.com/) as a Developer/Trainer. My role is pretty varied - I'm currently developing a new feature for the Unity Editor, creating demo projects and writing tutorials on performance optimization.

Outside of work, I make [short games](https://reallyfancy.itch.io/) and run [Brighton Indies](https://twitter.com/brightonindies) and [Make Play Code](https://twitter.com/makeplaycode). I also speak at conferences, lecture (at college and degree level) and teach kids to code.

When I'm not doing anything to do with games I like making music, cooking and visiting theme parks.
